Hi! My name is Mathieu. At the time I'm writing this post, I'm 25 years old.  
Here is a quick overview of my background:
* I started programming at 14 years old with python scripts.
* Interested in **gamedev**, I joined a Game Design School in France. I learned one thing here: how to get
in debt, and how to learn things by myself. (*I also met wonderful people*)
* After that, I Co-founded [Tales Up](https://talesup.io) with some friends I
met during my studies. I stayed there one year, where I mostly kept learning 
by myself while building a real game, with lot of things at stakes.
* Kind of burned out by this pressure, I decided to leave and a few months after
that, I joined **Ubisoft Ivory Tower**, where I am currently a **QA Engineer*.
My job is basically to automate stuff.

This sums up my professional life until today.

## What I'm going to talk about here.

Honestly I have no idea yet. But I know one thing: not about very advanced stuff,
there's people with 10x more experience than me, teaching very well already. I do 
not believe to know a lot of cool stuff, but maybe I can talk about one or two things
and I hope to help people learn along the way!

See you!
